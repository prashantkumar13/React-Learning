context API

why we use context API?

The Context API in React is used to manage and share state or data across multiple components without passing props through each level of the component tree. It helps to solve the problem of "prop drilling," where you have to pass data down through several layers of nested components, even if only a few of them actually need the data.

key feature of Context API ?

1:- Readeability increases
